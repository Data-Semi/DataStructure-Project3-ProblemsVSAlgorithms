# DataStructure-Project3-ProblemsVSAlgorithms

This is the 3rd project of Udacity's Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree Program.  
I have used data structures like Trie, Recursion, Priority queue, in this project.

I have written 7 sets of files to answer 7 problems as below.

1. Finding the Square Root of an Integer  
problem_1.py, explanation_1.md

2. Search in a Rotated Sorted Array  
problem_2.py, explanation_2.md

3. Rearrange Array Elements  
problem_3.py, explanation_3.md  

4. Dutch National Flag Problem  
problem_4.py, explanation_4.md

5. Autocomplete with Tries  
problem_5.py, explanation_5.md

6. Max and Min in a Unsorted Array  
problem_6.py, explanation_6.md

7. HTTPRouter using a Trie  
problem_7.py, explanation_7.md

## Description of the solutions

The description of 7 problems is included in each jupyter notes inside the folder [__Project3_jupyter_notes](https://github.com/Data-Semi/DataStructure-Project3-ProblemsVSAlgorithms/tree/main/_Project3_jupyter_notes).  
Code solutions are in a separate file like "problem_1.py" which includes at least 3 test cases for each solution.  
For each test case, I wrote the function call with the input to test and print it to the console.
At least 2 of these are edge cases, testing inputs such as null values, empty inputs, unusually large values, etc.  
An explanation for each question is in a markdown file like "explanation_1.md" which explaines why did I use that data structure and efficiency (time and space) of the solution.

Note: Time complexity for reading the input will not be considered in the overall complexity of the solution.

This folder is just for your reference. It includes files downloaded by jupyter notes above.

## Special thanks
Thanks to Udacity's mentors who helped me improve my coding and analysis skills.  

## Environment
I used python version of Python3.7 in above programs.
