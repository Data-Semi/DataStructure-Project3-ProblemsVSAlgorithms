    "\n",
    "Max and Min in an Unsorted Array In this problem, we will look for the smallest and largest integers from a list of unsorted integers. \n",
    "The function `get_min_max` can find the max and min of an integer array in a single traversal without use Python's inbuilt functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting usually requires O(n log n) time, but the function `counting_sort` can sort an integer array with a time complexity of O(n).\n",
    "The condition is: The array should include integer(>=0) only.\n",

    "After this, the program traverses the Unsorted array again, increase the element of count_array[e] accordingly. The index e is the element of the Unsorted array. This will take time complexity of O(n).  \n",
