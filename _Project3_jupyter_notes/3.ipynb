    "\n",
    "## Program description  \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is sorting the elements and put them into 2 arrays by order.  \n",
    "The steps are as below.  \n",
    "Step1: Make 2 empty arrays, array0, array1.  \n",
    "Step2: Find the maximum element from `input_list`, put it to array0.  \n",
    "Step3: Find the maximum element from the rest of `input_list`, put it to array1.  \n",
    "Step4: Repeat Step2, Step3 until final element of `input_list`.  \n",
    "Step5: Combine elements in array0 to an integer. Do the same thing to array1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If I sort the `input_list` and make array1, array2 similar to Step2, Step3 above, I need to go through all elements after the sort.  \n",
    "This means I need extra time complexity O(n). Because \"Merge sort\" takes O(nlog(n)), \"Quick sort\" takes O(nlog(n)) in a good pivot(we need to use extra O(n) to choose the best pivot), I decided to not use this method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the \"sort first\" solution, I choose to use heapsort to get the maximum element every time. and pop the maximum element to array0, array1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time compexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `rearrange_digits` is a heapsort function plus Step2-Step4 above.  \n",
    "Because the funciton `heapify` has time complexity of O(log(n)), and I need to do `heapify` every time after I get the maximum element in a subtree. This means I need to do n time of `heapify`. Therefore, my program has time complexity of O(nlog(n)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Space complexity  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of all space uses in this program is constant size and not impacted by the input list, the space complexity is O(1)."
